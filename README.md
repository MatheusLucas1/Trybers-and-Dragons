## Description

The Trybers and Dragons - T&D project is an initiative that aims to apply the principles of SOLID architecture and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in an exciting role-playing game (RPG).

In T&D, players are transported to a fictional world where they take on the roles of characters belonging to different races, each with their unique characteristics such as hit points and dexterity. Additionally, characters have specific archetypes representing their vocations and individual abilities.

The core of the game lies in the battles between player-controlled characters and monsters. These battles are based on attributes and specific abilities of each character, adding a strategic element to the battles.
